          <p>Translation is an important tool on StoryWeaver, one that gives you the power to take stories to children who love to read stories in languages of their choice - languages that you may be proficient in!</p>
          <p>If you like a story on StoryWeaver, but find that it is not available in a language that you are fluent in, do consider translating it so that it travels far and wide.</p>
          <p>Here are a few tips that you may find useful while translating: </p>

          <p><b>How to Translate</b></p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Select a story you would like to translate. Choose the ‘Translate’ option at the bottom panel of the story to get started.</li>
            <li>This will take you to the ‘Translate’ page where you can select the language of your choice. (If the language of your choice has not been listed yet, please send us an email to <a href="mailto:help@storyweaver.org.in">help@storyweaver.org.in</a>. We'll be happy to add it!)</li>
            <li>The story will now open in the Story Editor along with the original text as a reference for you while translating. This reference text does not get published.</li>  
            <li>Start translating the text phonetically in the text box. For example, you can type “namaste” in English to get "नमस्ते" in Hindi, which sounds like “Namaste”. As you start typing the word in English, a list of possible transliterations will appear. Choose the one you want and press 'Enter'.</li>
            <li>As StoryWeaver is still in Beta, our Transliteration Tools aren't as efficient as we'd like it to be.  If you are unable to find a certain word/symbol in the Editor, we recommend that you use Google Input tools . From Google Input tools, you can just copy & paste the correct text into StoryWeaver.</li>
            <li>Please note that only Unicode fonts work on StoryWeaver as it’s a universally accepted standard display of font.</li>

          <p><b>Short Guide to Translating Well</b></p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Language of the translation should be child-friendly (suitable for specific Reading Level).</li>
            <li>The translation must maintain the flavour and essence of the original.</li>
            <li>Wherever necessary, deviation from the original is allowed, as long as it adds value to the translation.</li>
            <li>The volume of translation can be slightly different but not very much more than the original. Example: A 5-line paragraph in English can be translated into a 7-line paragraph in another language but not into a 10-line paragraph. If necessary, a line or two can be cut in translation if it does not alter the story.</li>
            <li>Please do not translate puns and idioms that do not work in the other language. On the flip side, if a pun or idiom can be used afresh in the translation, you are most welcome.</li>
            <li>After you have finished the translation, please do read it again independently (without the original in mind) and see if the text flows naturally.</li>
            <li>Replace less common words with common words and phrases. Check spellings, consistency (a 'he' should not become 'it' or 'she' for example), facts, etc. 
            h. Do keep the original story open in a separate tab, to ensure you can maintain the formatting of the text  as is in the original story.</li>
            <li>Remember, the child who reads the translated book may or may not read the original. It is more important therefore that the translation should be enjoyable, understandable and logical, in itself, rather than strive to make it artificially close to the original.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to publish your story, please remember the story title and synopsis must both be in the language you have chosen for translation.</li>
